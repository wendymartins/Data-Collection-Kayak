## Company's description

The company was founded in 2004 by Steve Hafner & Paul M. English. After a few rounds of fundraising, Kayak was acquired by <a href="https://www.bookingholdings.com/" target="_blank">Booking Holdings</a> which now holds:
<a href="https://booking.com/" target="_blank">Booking.com</a> - <a href="https://kayak.com/" target="_blank">Kayak</a> - <a href="https://www.priceline.com/" target="_blank">Priceline</a> - <a href="https://www.agoda.com/" target="_blank">Agoda</a> - <a href="https://Rentalcars.com/" target="_blank">RentalCars</a> - <a href="https://www.opentable.com/" target="_blank">OpenTable</a>


With over $300 million revenue a year, Kayak operates in almost all countries and all languages to help their users book travels accros the globe.


## Project

After doing some user research, the marketing team discovered that 70% of their users who are planning a trip would like to have more information about the destination they are going to.

User research shows that people tend to be defiant about the information they are reading if they don't know the brand which produced the content.

Therefore, Kayak Marketing Team would like to create an application that will recommend where people should plan their next holidays.

The application should be able to recommend the best destinations and hotels based on weather and hotels in the area at any given time.


## Our Goal

* Scrape data from destinations
* Get weather data from each destination
* Get hotelsâ€™ info about each destination
* Store all the information above in a data lake
* Extract, transform and load cleaned data from a datalake to a data warehouse
* Create animated framed graphics
